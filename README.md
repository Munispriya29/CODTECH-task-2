overview of the project:

     Project: Predictive Modeling with Linear Regression

      Objective: Implement a simple linear regression model to predict continuous target variables using a dataset.

      Dataset: Boston Housing dataset

Tasks:

   1. Data Preprocessing: Load the dataset, handle missing values, and perform feature scaling (if necessary).

   2. Data Split: Split the data into training and testing sets (e.g., 80% for training and 20% for testing).

   3. Model Training: Train a linear regression model on the training data.

   4. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.

   5. Prediction: Make predictions on the test data.

   6. Visualization: Visualize the regression line and actual vs. predicted values to assess the model's accuracy.


  Deliverables:

- A Jupyter Notebook or Python script with the implemented linear regression model.
- A brief report summarizing the model's performance and any observations from the visualization.

Skills Demonstrated:

- Data preprocessing and feature scaling
- Model training and evaluation
- Prediction and visualization
- Understanding of linear regression concepts and metrics (MSE, R-squared)

Tools and Libraries:

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn (for linear regression)
- Matplotlib (for visualization)
